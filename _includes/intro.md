## About Me

I am a final-year Ph.D. student advised by [Weiming Lu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=H42slBQAAAAJ) and [Yueting Zhuang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/yzhuang) at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) since 2019. I am a member of [DCD Lab](http://www.cs.zju.edu.cn/_upload/article/files/d4/45/e46a2ca6469693738d84d1fffc3f/262af9de-795a-4f36-8da5-35d2b4259c88.pdf). My research interests include large language models and knowledge graph. I am also interested in generative models. From 2021 to 2022, I was a research intern at [Alibaba DAMO Academy](https://damo.alibaba.com/), mentored by Xiaobin Wang and [Yong Jiang](https://jiangyong.site/). Now I am a research intern at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.msra.cn), mentored by [Kaitao Song](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LLk9dR8AAAAJ) and [Xu Tan](https://tan-xu.github.io/).

<!-- I received my B.S. degree from [Soochow University](http://eng.suda.edu.cn/) in 2019, supervised by [Zongzhang Zhang](https://ai.nju.edu.cn/zhangzongzhang/index.htm).  -->

## Research Interests

- **Large Language Models**, especially on [LLM powered autonomous agents](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/) and multimodal LLMs, focusing on the abilities of LLMs for planning, tool use, memory, and environment interaction.
- **Knowledge Graph**, especially on knowledge-enhanced LMs and information extraction (*e.g.* named entity recognition, relation extraction).
- **Generative AI**, use large models to create new content, such as text, images, and videos, especially on collaborative, controllable and efficient content generation.
